Simple Mixer Wrapper Class plus Test Driver. Unfortunately the Mixer interface is rather complicated - maybe written by a musician *g* - so there are quite a few mystic API calls with plenty of params, mixer-constants with ugly names, cryptic structure types, and virtual memory address pointers from one structure into the next. And Micro$oft's documentation is slim, to put it polite, but I tried my best to put all that into a wrapper with a simple interface: You choose the Channel and SoundControl; this will return True if the selection was successful, and then Get or Let the Value. (Note that ALL values are in %  - for booleans (like Mute) the value 0 means False and 100 means True - one hundred percent true, so to say).
